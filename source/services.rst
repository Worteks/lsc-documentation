Services
********

Two types of services exist: 

* source services which are used to read objects
* target services which are used to check existing objects status and to write updates

Existing source services allow data to be read from the following data sources:

* :doc:`Database source service <service_source_database>`
* :doc:`LDAP source service <service_source_ldap>`
* :doc:`Event based LDAP source service <service_source_asyncldap>`


Existing destination services allow data to be updated from the following data sources:

* :doc:`Database destination service <service_destination_database>`
* :doc:`LDAP destination service <service_destination_ldap>`

.. tip::

    Other source and destination services are available through :doc:`plugins <index>` (NIS,...)
